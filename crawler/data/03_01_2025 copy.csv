2025-01-03,19,US,UNCHANGED,3UyND4EBNY6IcCyO5n0uET,1cpyLfDHP1cNnyOb478qrt,Episode 632: The Suspected Crimes of Guy Muldavin,"When a girl walking on a Provincetown, Massachusetts beach discovered the decomposing body of a young woman in the summer of 1974, it began an investigation into what would become one of the most notorious cold cases in the state’s history. The victim—who would remain unidentified for nearly five decades—and her killer were the source of much speculation, with theories ranging from an extra in Jaws to the victim of the local mob. After decades of mystery, DNA from the remains of “the Lady of the Dunes” was subject to extensive genetic matching and was finally identified as thirty-seven-year-old California resident Ruth Terry. A year later, authorities in Massachusetts announced their main suspect in the murder was Guy Muldavin, Terry’s husband at the time of her death. Muldavin died in 2002 and thus couldn’t be prosecuted for the crime, so the case was finally closed. Identifying Ruth’s killer brought an end to one of the most enduring murder mysteries in Massachusetts, yet identifying the Lady of the Dunes and her killer turned out to the be the beginning of a new mystery. Indeed, investigators soon learned this might not have been Muldavin’s first murder, but one of several mysterious disappearances that traced back to him.Thank you to the Incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research and Writing support!ReferencesAbrams, Norma, and Sidney Kline. 1960.

We discuss the biology of human emotions and motivations, healthy versus destructive impulses, addictions, and generative drives. Topics include how brain states shape decision-making—for better or worse—and how religion and culture can guide us toward and through the best paths in life. We also explore the innate human drive to create ""impact at a distance"" and how it influences social interactions, educational pursuits, career choices, and relationships. Additional subjects include morality, social media, politics, the human appetite for drama, and the importance of embracing responsibility as a form of adventure to avoid wasting time.

Just a couple of hours earlier, the body of a young woman was found in a field one town over – and police had no clue who the young woman was. The physical description was vague, but it matched all three of the woman’s daughters. So right away, she picked up her phone and began trying to reach them, to make sure each of them was okay. Her two youngest girls replied within minutes, but the oldest one of them did not. And with every minute that passed without a word from her oldest daughter, the woman became more and more frantic until she reached out to a friend of hers on the police force. And what she soon would learn, before the morning became afternoon, would change her family’s life forever... and change the course of two separate police investigations.For 100s more stories like these, check out our main YouTube channel just called ""MrBallen"" -- https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBallenIf you want to reach out to me, contact me on Instagram, Twitter or any other major social media platform, my username on all of them is @mrballenSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",2338142,2024-12-30

Through personal stories and expert interviews, Dickens uncovers a phenomenon she never thought possible—a hidden form of communication that defies mainstream science. Through a mix of personal anecdotes, scientific exploration, and interviews with experts like Dr. Diane Hennessy Powell, a Johns Hopkins-trained neuropsychiatrist, Dickens unpacks the mysterious connection between parents and their children, who seemingly can read minds. The episode takes listeners on a journey across the globe, meeting families who have experienced this phenomenon firsthand, and challenges the skeptic in all of us. Dickens brings listeners into a world where telepathy may not just be possible, but commonplace. She opens up a conversation about the potential of the human mind that mainstream science has largely ignored, inviting listeners to reconsider everything they thought they knew about communication and consciousness.

But 2024 certainly was eventful. Joe Biden dropped out of the race at the eleventh hour, and Kamala Harris’s swift anointment brought us the joy of Brat summer. There was not one, but two assassination attempts against Donald Trump; the continued wars in Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, and Lebanon; the sudden and surprising fall of the Assad regime in Syria; the murder of a CEO (and Luigi Mania); mystery drones over New Jersey; and finally, Trump's decisive reelection to the White House.   On a cheerier note, 2024 was also the year of breakdancing at the Paris Olympics; Claudine Gay’s resignation from Harvard; SpaceX’s first commercial spacewalk; and Israel’s epic spy-thriller, pager-explosion attack on Hezbollah—not to mention they took out Hezbollah’s Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas’s Yahya Sinwar as well.  So, what will 2025 bring?   We are starting the year, as we did last December, with a special 2025 predictions episode of Honestly. We called up some friends of the pod—people we trust in their fields—to get a better sense of what’s in store for the year ahead.   Political analyst and former spokesperson at the Department of Justice Sarah Isgur tells us what we can expect in the Trump 2.0 White House. Linguist John McWhorter looks at new words and how language will evolve in the coming months. Our very own Suzy Weiss talks us through the cultural calendar. Stylist Leandra Medine clues us in on fashion trends in 2025, and last but not least: Historian Niall Ferguson tells us, as he did last year as well, whether or not we’re right to have nightmares about World War III—but for real this time.   Some guests cheered us up, whereas others freaked us out. All of them were a pleasure to talk to.

Everyone has their own explanations for it but it’s that simple.  Every time she sets the dinner table - she stares at the empty seat. Sometimes smiling, sometimes pouting, but always as if someone is sitting there.  Sang would ask -  “Mom, is everything alright?” “Just make sure to save some of the meat for Niuniu - you know that’s her favorite.” Sang’s mom would motion at the empty chair and smile.  The haunting started when Niuniu, Sang’s little sister, went missing. Nobody knew what happened to her other than the fact that she received a creepy doll with moving eyes shortly before she went missing.  26 years later Niuniu would come back to tell everyone the truth. She was kidnapped, trafficked, and sold. After 26 years she was coming back to kill her trafficker.

Ky travels to New Jersey to meet Akhil, a college student with nonverbal autism, and his mother, Manisha. What begins as an exploration of telepathy soon reveals something far more profound—a merging of consciousness. Akhil not only reads thoughts but appears to share his mother’s awareness, sensing details about her experiences without being physically present. Through a series of astonishing tests, Akhil demonstrates an ability to perceive the world in ways that challenge the very foundations of science. Akhil demonstrates an uncanny ability to read minds, accurately state randomly generated numbers and words, interpret abstract images, and solve complex equations without ever seeing the inputs. As Ky navigates between scientific skepticism and the lived realities of families like Akhil’s, this episode challenges our understanding of the mind and opens the door to possibilities that defy conventional science. Join Ky as the journey into the mysterious world of telepathy deepens, revealing insights that could reshape how we perceive consciousness, connection and what it truly means to be human.

She is no longer asking if telepathy is possible but how it’s possible. The episode delves into historical and contemporary examples of telepathy, including Lucille Ball’s strange encounter with radio signals through her dental fillings and telepathy experiments by author Upton Sinclair. The narrative deepens as Ky recounts the story of Katie and her non-speaking son, Houston, who can read minds. Houston telepathically engages with other non-speakers in a phenomenon they call “the talk on the hill.” Through rigorous testing, including number generation and UNO card tests, Houston repeatedly demonstrates his telepathic abilities to the amazement of the local Atlanta crew. The episode highlights the challenges faced by families with non-speaking children, their journey to find hope and the potential implications of telepathy as a shared reality, suggesting a profound interconnectedness among humans. The episode sets the stage for further exploration into this mysterious phenomenon in future episodes. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",2606080,2024-09-23

Kylie wanted an “Ask Me Anything” but based on some of the responses, she’s rebranding it… Ask Me *Some* Things. And since Christmas is right around the corner, Kylie gets honest about “Elf on the Shelf,” specifically the Kelce family Elf who Wyatt named M&M-Y (7:15). Kylie explains M&M-Y’s low maintenance lifestyle and her main concern about kids comparing elf notes. Then, Charissa Thompson, host of Thursday Night Football and Fox NFL Kickoff joins Kylie to talk where they first met many years ago (13:10), as well as the first time they actually got to hang out properly earlier this year (16:20). Kylie also asks Charissa about her work as the host of “TNF,” the process of getting camera ready and the dynamic between Charissa and the rest of the analysts on the desk (20:40). Charissa talks about her desire to uplift other women in the sports world (29:53) and why she and Erin Andrews decided to start a podcast together (34:25). Kylie then asks Charissa about a topic she’s been open about: her choice to not have kids and how she ultimately arrived at that decision (36:52). As Kylie mentions in the show, these episodes are capped at 45 minutes so you can find even more exclusive, never-before-seen clips from her conversation with Charissa Thompson on YouTube on Monday.
